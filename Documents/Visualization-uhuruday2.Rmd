## 1. Describing the working data set

UHURU data set

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Acacia_smallii_4.jpg/640px-Acacia_smallii_4.jpg)

## 2. Reading the data set

We are reading a data set in TSV format. This is a "tab separated values" dfiles. To read it into R we use the function read.csv with the `sep =` argument set to `"\t"` which represents a tab in computer language

```{r eval=TRUE}
 read.csv(file = "../data-raw/ACACIA_DREPANOLOBIUM_SURVEY.txt", sep = "\t")
```

Assign the data to a variable so we can work with it

```{r eval=TRUE}
acacia <- read.csv(file = "../data-raw/ACACIA_DREPANOLOBIUM_SURVEY.txt", sep = "\t")
```

### 3. Accessing elements of a 'data.frame'

It is similiar to what we do for vetors, but we have two dimensions

```{r}
acacia[,6]
str(acacia)
1:100
```

All the following are different ways of accessing certain points in dead

```{r}
numbers <- 1:10
numbers
numbers [3:6]
numbers[c(1,5,7,3)]
acacia$SURVEY
acacia[,1]
acacia[,"SURVEY"]
```

### Replacing elements in a data.frame

First we locate the element we want to replace

```{r}
numbers[5] <- 100
numbers
```

## 4. Quality Control check

Check that everything is the correct class and type

```{r}
head(acacia)
str(acacia)
acacia
class(acacia$HEIGHT)
is.numeric(acacia$HEIGHT)
acacia$HEIGHT
as.numeric(acacia$HEIGHT)

```

We identified that HEIGHT should be numeric and is instead character

```{r}
acacia$HEIGHT <- as.numeric(acacia$HEIGHT)
acacia$HEIGHT

```

Coercion in R computer language means that a value was forced to be a type, in this case, the word "dead" cannot be transformed to a number, so it is assigned the NA value

```{r}
acacia <- read.csv(file = "../data-raw/ACACIA_DREPANOLOBIUM_SURVEY.txt",
         sep = "\t",
         na.strings ="Dead")
is.numeric(acacia$HEIGHT)
```

### 5. Plotting data with 'ggplot2'

Regular way to plot in R

```{r}
plot(x=acacia$HEIGHT, y=acacia$AXIS1, main = "Acacia Height vs Circumference")
legend(x = 1, y = 5, legend = "Acacia Trees")

```

With ggplot, we create layers

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = acacia, mapping = aes(x = HEIGHT, y = AXIS1, color = TREATMENT)) +
geom_point(size = 2)
labs(x ="Tree Height", y = "Tree Axis 1", title = "Acacia Trees Size Relationships")

```

```{r}
colors()
```


### Rescaling Axes 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = acacia, mapping = aes(x = HEIGHT, y = FRUITS, color = ANT)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ANT)
```

### Fitting Linear Models

the geom_smooth() function allows finding trends in our data

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(acacia, aes(x = HEIGHT, y = FRUITS, color = TREATMENT, linetype = TREATMENT)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_smooth()
```

### Data Distribution: Histograms and bar plots

The function geom_bar() created bar plots and can be used for categoric or discrete variables

The function geom_histogram() creates histpograms and can only be used for continous variables

This code is creating a bar plot of the number of plants for each treatment:

```{r}
ggplot(data = acacia, mapping =aes(x = TREATMENT)) +
  geom_bar()
```

This code shows the distribution of circumference values with red colored bars

```{r}
ggplot(acacia, aes(x= FRUITS)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "red")
```

This code will show the proportion of datqa colored by treatment

The "bins =" arguments defines the number of bins "Fill =" arugments aloows the defining color inside the bars

```{r}
ggplot(acacia, aes(x = CIRC, color = TREATMENT)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20)
```

We can use the treatmenet data to assigna fill color with a gray outline

```{r}
ggplot (acacia, aes(x = CIRC, fill = TREATMENT)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = "gray")
```

### Layering Multiple Data

To plot different data or variables on the same plot, we can change these values across layers

```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = acacia,
             mapping =aes(x = HEIGHT, y = FRUITS,
                          color = TREATMENT)) +
  geom_smooth(data = acacia,
              mapping = aes(x = HEIGHT, y = FRUITS))
```

We can also plot categorical and continous data on the same plot

```{r}
ggplot() +
geom_point(data = acacia,
           mapping = aes(x = HEIGHT, y = FRUITS,
                         color = TREATMENT)) +
geom_smooth(data = acacia,
            mapping = aes(x = HEIGHT, y = FRUITS)) +
geom_histogram(data = acacia,
               mapping = aes(x = HEIGHT, color = TREATMENT),
               alpha = 0.1)
```

### Saving Plots as Image Files

using the function ggsave() filename = is included as the main argument this indicates the path where the image is saved the name we want to give the saved image the type of file we will save it as

```{r}
ggsave("acacia_by_treatment.jpg")
```

This argument can change the size of image in inches

```{r}
ggsave("acacia_by_treatment.pdf", height = 5, width = 5)
```
