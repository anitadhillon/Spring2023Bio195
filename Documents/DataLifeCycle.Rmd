2. Collection - collect the data from specfic groups to ensure that the results will not be varied
3. Processing - data should be cleaned and altered to be easily understood
4. Visualize - arrange data in graphical representations so that they can be easily interpreted
5. Analyze - analyze the data using the graphical representations/ information that was collected 
6. Intepretation - describe/explain the data collected and its implications if any 
7. Storage - compress the data and the results in a digital file for future use

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
